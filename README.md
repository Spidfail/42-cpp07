Eight day of the C++ learning pool of the school.

## How to use it

There is a Makefile for compiling (`make`) cleaning the project (`make clean`, `make fclean`) and rebuild it (`make re`).

## Tasks

This is an approach of generic types in C++ called `templates`.

First with a simple function swapping values of the same type, then returning the max or the min of two values.

Then, a function that iterates over an array to apply a function. `iter` is overloaded to meet different types of function as parameter.

Finally we had to build a simple form of **dynamic array** with to operators (assignation and accessor) and a getter returning the size.
